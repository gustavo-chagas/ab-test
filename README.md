# A/B Test

## Context of the project
An e-commerce wants to test a new page where only the color of the "buy" button has been changed. The design team believes that the average conversion of the page will increase from 13% to 15%. An A/B test was made and the data from the test was sent do the data team. The data team has to give an answer whether the new page was effective or not.
